# gbpinter_dump2image_py
quick and dirty batch converting of raw gameboy camera image data to png

- use Python 3
- install pillow python package (pip install pillow or pip3 install when python 3 is not the default version)
- the script expects “gbDump.out” file and “images/4x/” folders to be present
- the script will overwrite files present in this folder so copy all your images before you do the next batch

One great way to capture the image data:
